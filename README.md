## Overview

### The challenge

<ul>
    <li>When the game starts all the cards are placed randomly and facedown.</li>
    <li>Each player takes turns to pick two cards.</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>If the two cards match, the player keeps them and gets another turn.</li>
        <li>If they don't match, the cards are turned back over and it's the next player's turn.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>The game continues until all the cards have been matched and picked up.</li>
    <li>The player with the most pairs of cards is the winner.</li>
    <li>A pop up will show and it will tell you how the winner is.</li>
    <li>You will then get a choice to click and restart the game.</li>
</ul>
